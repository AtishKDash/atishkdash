### Hi there, I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atish-dash/">Atish Kumar Dash</a>!
Specializing in Management Information Systems (MIS) at the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/">University at Buffalo</a>, I am currently immersed in my MS journey, primarily focusing on Technical Project Management, Cybersecurity, and Data analytics.

With ~6 years of experience post-MBA, I've navigated through diverse roles within Technical Project Management, spanning sectors like Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPG) and e-Commerce/Retail. My journey has been about driving digital transformations, touching upon IT Strategic Transformation, Agile Methodologies, Cybersecurity, Governance, Compliance, Risk Management, and Digital Analytics.

My academic foundation includes an MBA from <a href="https://ximb.edu.in/">Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB)</a>, and a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <a href="https://www.soa.ac.in/iter">I.T.E.R., Bhubaneswar</a>.

Beyond the professional realm, I'm an avid reader with a penchant for non-fiction, especially titles covering science, technology, business, and biographies. Writing is another passion, and I find joy in delving into tech-focused podcasts and indulging in alternative rock music.

As I journey towards becoming a data-driven Cybersec Technical Project Manager, I'm eager to leverage my diverse expertise, analytical acumen, and communication skills to drive impactful projects from inception to execution. Let's connect and discuss more!
