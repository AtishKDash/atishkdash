### Hi there, I am Atish Kumar Dash!
Specializing in Management Information Systems (MIS) at the University at Buffalo, I am currently immersed in my MS journey, primarily focusing on Technical Project Management, Cybersecurity, and Data analytics.

With ~6 years of enriching experience post-MBA, I've navigated through diverse roles within Technical Project Management, spanning sectors like Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPG) and e-Commerce/Retail. My journey has been about driving digital transformations, touching upon IT Strategic Transformation, Agile Methodologies, Cybersecurity, Governance, Risk Management, and Digital Analytics.

My academic foundation includes an MBA from Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB), and a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from I.T.E.R., Bhubaneswar.

Beyond the professional realm, I'm an avid reader with a penchant for non-fiction, especially titles covering science, technology, business, and biographies. Writing is another passion, and I find joy in delving into tech-focused podcasts and indulging in alternative rock music.

As I journey towards becoming a data-driven Cybersec Technical Project Manager, I'm eager to leverage my diverse expertise, analytical acumen, and communication skills to drive impactful projects from inception to execution. Let's connect and discuss more!
